      <h3>Online learning style test</h3>
        <p><strong>Tactile</strong></p>
        <p><i>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing.
              You understand and remember things through physical movement. You
              are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or
              draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type
              of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take
              frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with
              gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</i></p>
        <p><i>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put
              things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move
              around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated
              and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things
              that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw
              or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and
              you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such
              as a pat on the back.</i></p>
        <p><i>Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to
              learn better: </i></p>
        <li><i>
          Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving,
          or drawing.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking
          walks, or acting out stories.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or
          studying.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships
          between ideas.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent,
          but not long).
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something
          while learning.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.
        </i></li>
        <li><i>
          Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing,
          or hearing.
        </i></li>
      <h3>Online Test of your choosing - Hogwarts House</h3>
        <p><b>Ravenclaw</b></p>
        <p><i>The Ravenclaw house shares numerous characteristics with the C
          style personality. These people are task-oriented, and for the
          Ravenclaws this means working very hard to achieve good grades. The
          C style Ravenclaws are analytical, systematic, and calculating. They
          excel at puzzles and at improving upon existing systems. Open-minded
          to new possibilities, Ravenclaws/Cs are excellent problem-solvers
          because they pay attention to details and see the things that no one
          else sees. (Think Luna Lovegood when she realized that Rowena
          Ravenclaw’s diadem may have been seen by a ghost rather than a living
          person.) Like the D style Slytherins, Ravenclaws aren’t concerned
          with popularity. A Ravenclaw is more concerned with being correct and
          well- informed. (You can see why the sorting hat had such a hard time
          placing Hermione, as she is more of a Gryffinclaw.) This house/style
          takes great pride in being accurate and correct and fears criticism.
          Because these people are task-oriented rather than people-oriented,
          they may occasionally be seen as eccentric, but Ravenclaws are ok
          with that. Just as long as you don’t see them as wrong.</i></p>
      <h3>Brief report on tests</h3>
        <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
          <p>These tests all indicate I’m a creative person (which I believe is
            incredibly true for me), I take this as a good sign I have the
            ability to come up with some great ideas. I also recognise from the
            Myers-Briggs test that I am quite empathic; meaning I can easily
            read the room and recognise other people’s emotions and reactions
            to certain situations. </p>
          <p>The learning style test done through Education Planner was not at
            all surprising in its result, what I take from the answer of being
            a tactile learner is that I will have to ensure anything I try to
            learn I can also physically do. This will help with remembering
            each step to things and allow me to have a better understanding of
            the topic. </p>
        <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
          <p>The results I obtained have a hint of leadership in them, although
            it’s more of a shared-leadership role that I enjoy having,
            where each person of the team is leading their own section. I think
            this is a great thing to have as everyone has their own expertise in
            any one field. Another part of the results I got was the empathy;
            this I believe is a great skill to have when working as part of a
            team as I can get a better understanding of how other’s a feeling
            about certain topics and/or ideas and when members may feel left out
            or let down.  </p>
          <p>To me, these results indicate that I am a great team player who
            will work great in a team. However, the downsides I will face will
            be through my rash decision making and my want to do everything at
            one time. I tend to stop midway through a project to start on
            another and this can be quite detrimental to a team. Another
            hardship I’ll face is my want to please everyone, sometimes in a
            team it requires quite a bit of compromising and I have to be sure
            that I’m not compromising too much that way the others will be happy.
          </p>
        <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
          <p>As part of a team, I need to consider having other members to match
            my energy well, I would look for people who enjoy having a shared
            leadership, who are great at motivating everyone and checking in on
            each other to make sure we’re all keeping up with our load. I would
            also need to ensure I am thinking about my interest for the group
            and making sure it doesn’t go astray.</p>
