     <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <h3>General</h3>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Elijah Quinton-Crowe- I know quite a mouthful
          Everyone aside from my mother just calls me Eli (Ee-lie),
          although I do answer to both Eli and Elijah. I am a 20-year-old
          transgender male, meaning I was born female however my true gender is
          in fact male.I was born in Melbourne, Victoria and grew up there until
          I was 17 years old where I moved out of home to Cairns, Queensland.
          I am currently living here with my girlfriend, although we are looking
          at buying a home back down in Werribee, Victoria (at least that's the
          plan for the moment.)</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I completed my Year 12 High School Diploma in Victoria in 2018 and
          have since multiple qualifications at different universities/TAFEs,
          although none of them have stuck very well until my IT studies started.
          These qualifications include:</p>
        <li>Cert IV in Aged Care
        <li>Cert III in Business
        <li>Bachelor of Creative Writing(LaTrobe and Unviersity of Canberra)
        <li>Diploma of Higher Education: Edcuation(James Cook University)
        <p>I wish I could say I completed any one of those, but I never did
          as I didn't feel they were right for me. During high school I learnt
          French, Indonesian and Italian and am most confident in Indonesian
          although I can just barely hold a conversation in Italian. I'm out of
          practise in all of these though so I'm not sure how well I'd do now.
      <h3>Religion</h3>
        <p>My religion is rather interesting as I'm not fully versed in any one
          religion. For a few years I was most inclined to be called Wicken, that
          is the practise of mother nature and quite often is referred to as
          witchery. However, I never got involved in the making of potions using
          different herbs and the like, but I do feel most connected to a greater
          being that I refer to as mother Nature. I have recently (in the last
          6 months) have grown close to the practise of tarot reading, and Greek
          Gods, my Gods that I try to speak to include Dionysus, Athena, and Hades.</p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I have a vast variety of hobbies that I occupy my time with, this
          includes creative writing, reading, basketball, gaming and building
          computers. I started writing as soon as I learnt how to spell and have
          continued to make many short stories (that will never see the light of
          day) and am currently working on my own novel. When I was a child (6-9)
          my mother and I didnâ€™t own a TV, instead we would buy and read books
          together so I have always been an avid reader, my favourite books
          series at the moment would be Shadow and Bone and the following books
          within that universe. Surprisingly I have always loved sports and I
          follow the National Basketball League quite closely (Cairns Taipans
          is my team), I have played basketball since I was 5, refereed
          basketball since I was 14 and coached my own team since I was 17.
          Gaming and building computers are a rather new hobby that I am still
          developing and within that is also coming the love for programming
          and coding. </p>
