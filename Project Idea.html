     <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <h3>Puberty App</p>
        <p>The project I am planning to do is an application that will be able
          to be used on any phone or computer (so any website or phone
          application on Android or IOs). This app will be designed as a
          ‘Puberty App’ for anyone going through puberty. It will detail any
          and all activities, facts and tips for people of any gender going
          through puberty. This includes, but is not limited to; shaving
          (leg, armpits, chest, and face), skin care routines, bras, body care
          routines, sexual care (birth control, vasectomy, and condoms),
          periods, erections, mood swings. It will also include an LGBTQIA+
          section that will help everyone of any gender and/or sexual
          identity.</p>
        <p>A ‘Puberty App’ such as this one is a really big idea for me and has
          been for a few years as I never had a massive help from my parents or
          any other guardian figure on how to do things. Then as I came out as
          transgender and found so many young people who have to go through
          those changes alone, I tried to help in any possible way I could.
          45,714. According to The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
          (AIHW) that is the number of children who have been abused and don’t
          have a proper guardian in Australia.v An app of this significance
          could be a life changer for these young people as they’ll have
          something to refer to for questions and things about puberty that
          can be quite difficult and confusing.  </p>
        <p>Within the program of this ‘Puberty App’ key activities, facts and
          tips will be included; this describes the transformation that happens
          with estrogen, testosteronevi, gender transforming surgeries, sexual
          health and any other needs that come in later updates.   </p>
        <p>For anyone undergoing transformation through estrogen
          (whether that be cisgender or transfeminine) there will be
          information on: </p>
          <li>Bras; sizing, different types (Underwired, push-up, balconette,
            bralette, strapless, tube, sports, t-shirt, beginner’s, transparent,
            bridal, multiway, plunge, cage, halter, nursing, stick-on, full
            figure, padded, minimizer and racerback) </li>
          <li>Sexual health care; birth control (both the pill and the rod),
            condoms (why they’re important and how to use one) </li>
          <li>Periods; how they work and what they do, pads and tampons
            (the pros and cons for both and the different brands)  </li>
          <li>Mood swings; the most common moods associated with estrogen. </li>
        <p>Anyone undergoing transformation through testosterone (whether that
          be cisgender or transmasculine) there will be information on:  </p>
          <li>Development of testicles “balls dropping”.  </li>
          <li>Wet dreams. </li>
          <li>Erections; their function and general information. </li>
          <li>Sexual health care; vasectomy (function and information) and
            condoms (how and when to use and what they do).  </li>
          <li>Voice breaks. </li>
          <li>Mood swings; the most common moods associated with testosterone.</li>
        <p>For both estrogen and testosterone there will also be information on:</p>
          <li>Shaving; face, legs, under arms and chest (razors information,
            how-to videos, and step-by-step instructions), hair removal (waxing,
            cream, shaving cream, laser, epilators, plucking).  </li>
          <li>Skin care routines; creams, moisturizers, anti-acne etc.
            (different brands and uses). </li>
        <p>The LGBTQIA+ area will include information for both transfeminine and
          transmasculine. </p>
        <p>For transfeminine it will include:  </p>
          <li>Padding; sizing and how-to (padded bras and underwear) </li>
          <li>Body shaping; types (control top pantyhose, camisole, waist
            cincher) </li>
          <li>Gaffs; types (underwear, adhesive tape) </li>
          <li>Hormone effects (changes to face, increase in chest, decrease in
            genitals, changing of body shape, voice, mood swings) </li>
          <li>Surgeries; top surgery (breast implants), bottom surgery
            (Penile inversion, rectosigmoid or colon graft, non-penile inversion
            vaginoplasty). </li>
        <p>For transmasculine it will include: </p>
          <li>Binders; sizing and types (half, full, t-shirt, singlet, swimming)
          </li>
          <li>Packers; sizing and types (STP, soft, hard) </li>
          <li>Hormone effects (changes to face, reduction of chest, changing of
            body shape, voice, bottom growth, mood swings)  </li>
          <li>Surgeries; top surgery (Buttonhole, double incision,
            inverted-T/T-anchor, peri-areolar, keyhole, minimal scar),
            xibottom surgery (Metoidioplasty, phalloplasty). </li>
        <p>For both gender identification and sexual orientation there will be
          information on:  </p>
          <li>Different types of gender identification (Cisgender, transgender,
            gender nonconforming, nonbinary, genderqueer, genderfluid,
            gender-neutral, intersex)  </li>
          <li>Different types of sexual orientation (Straight, gay, lesbian,
            bisexual, pansexual, asexual, demisexual, graysexual) </li>
          <li>How to come out to your parents.</li>
          <li>What to do if your parents don’t accept what you say. </li>
          <li>LGBTQIA+ lines. </li>
        <p>In saying all of that, this app is not just for teenagers or those
          part of the LGBTQIA+, this app will be able to have use for parents
          and people who are generally curious. There will be an option to
          create an account or stay anonymous while still being able to save
          articles or ask questions. </p>
        <p>There will also be an area that is safe for people to report abuse or
          neglect on anyone and have the anonymity around it. There will be a
          very specific area around mental health that will have trigger
          warnings surrounded it.  </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I do not have any expertise in the development of web
          or mobile applications. However, I do know I will need software that
          can run debug on my coding of the application and allow me to run test
          drives to see what goes wrong and where it needs to be fixed. This
          software would also need to allow me to see how the application will
          look on the web or a mobile so I can make the necessary changes. I
          will also need a computer to do the actual coding on as well as one
          to ensure it works properly on another pc, if I get to be able to
          create a mobile application, I will also need an Android and IOs
          phone in order to test the app properly. </p>
        <p>To complete my project idea ‘Puberty App’ I will need to learn and
          understand how to create HTMLs and mobile applications. Using the
          software given to me during this course (so far ATOM) and the
          programming language I’m learning in another class (so far Python)
          I will be able to develop my application. To be able to attain the
          proper skills detailed above I will need to complete this course as
          well as undertake my own research into the different software to use.
          I will start this by emailing my course tutor later in the course to
          find out about what my options are.  </p>
        <p>I would also need a great understanding of the process and options of
          puberty and for LGBTQIA+, this will require amounts of research that I
          have already begun and potentially interviewing people who have
          specialised in this field.  </p>
        <p>If I am successful in creating my ‘Puberty App’ this will give all
          people of all gender orientation, sexual identity and backgrounds of
          abuse and neglect an opportunity to learn about things that should
          have been taught to them at a young age. It will not solve the problem
          of neglect and abuse that goes on; however, it will help educate these
          people in areas where their parents or guardians might have failed or
          not educated themselves on. I am hoping that the impact of my ‘Puberty
          App’ will be one of education and validation on the people who need it
          and seek it out. Another one of my wishes is that once this
          application is made and published there will be more ideas and
          suggestions from outside people that can be added to give everyone
          and anyone the best chance possible.  </p>
