    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
        <p>I have always had a knack for technology and the older I got the more
           I found myself relying on each piece I had. I currently own 3
           monitors, 3 keyboards, 2 mice, 2 gaming desktop towers, an Xbox One
           S, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo DS lite, Nintendo 3DS XL
           and 5 laptops in various states of usability. I have collected all of
           this over the last 10 years and will probably continue to grow. As
           well as my love for technology I have always felt the drive to find
           out exactly how things work, this including opening up computers to
           see how they run and teaching myself as much as I can with my limited
           time about each part and how to make them better. This then turned
           into wanting to know how apps are created, and then websites and it
           grew from there. All of this interest led me to starting this course
           so I could learn as much as I could about it all. </p>
      <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
        <p>I chose RMIT as I read that it was one of the best universities in
          Australia for Technology, ranking in the top 10 at
          topuniversities.com. My sister also begun her studies here back in
          2019 in law (has since dropped out) and I have heard many great things
          about RMIT. Most of my knowledge of the school has come from word of
          mouth and then little research. I found RMIT through Open Universities
          Australia and it was the top result in searching for Bachelor of IT.</p>
      <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
        <p>As per the study guide on Canvas, I expect to learn how to build
          websites, different types of jobs within the IT industry, multiple
          platforms that I can use to connect with other IT developers, use of
          the Cloud, Mobile Technologies, AR and VR, Networking, and a dash of
          robotics. Not all these particulars interest me very much, however,
          Iâ€™m sure that with time I will want to understand how they all work
          and will get very much stuck into this course.</p>
